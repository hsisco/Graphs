"""
Return their earliest known ancestor...the one with the lowest numeric ID. 
If the input individual has no parents, the function should return -1
* The input will not be empty.
* There are no cycles in the input.
* There are no "repeated" ancestors â€“ if two individuals are connected, it is by exactly one path.
* IDs will always be positive integers.
* A parent may have any number of children.
